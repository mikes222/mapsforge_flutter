# mapsforge_flutter

Pure offline maps for flutter. This is a port of mapsforge for
java/android [https://github.com/mapsforge/mapsforge]

The main feature of this library is to read *mapfiles* stored locally at the user's device and
render the mapfiles directly on the user's device without internet connection.

> If your users are online while viewing the maps do not use that library. 
> While it is possible to show online-maps there are much simpler libs available out there to perform this task.

## Examples

Start with the [..simplified_example/README.md](../simplified_example/README.md)

Find many more examples in the subdirectory [../example/README.md](../example/README.md)

- Day and night themes
- World map
- Indoor examples
- Hillshading
- Context menus
- Markers
- Drag'n'drop
- Online-maps

## Limitations

Markers are currently not scaled while pinch'n'zoom

## Credits

First and foremost to the author of mapsforge. He has done an outstanding job!

Also to the university of chemnitz which implements indoor map support

## TODO

- support rotating map (do not rotate the text and icons)
- some flaws with text spawning multiple tiles

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

include the library in your pubspec.yaml:

```yaml
  mapsforge_flutter: ^2.0.2
    # path: ../mapsforge_flutter
    # git:
    #  url: https://github.com/mikes222/mapsforge_flutter
```

Note: For development purposes consider to include the github repository directly.

include a list of all used assets in your ``pubspec.yaml`` (see pubspec file from example project)

```yaml
    flutter:

      assets:
        - packages/mapsforge_flutter/assets/patterns/coniferous.svg
        - packages/mapsforge_flutter/assets/patterns/coniferous_and_deciduous.svg
        - packages/mapsforge_flutter/assets/patterns/deciduous.svg
      ...
```

### Initializing mapsforge

Load the mapfile which holds the openstreetmap &reg; data

> Mapfiles are files specifically designed for mobile use and provide the information about an area in condensed form. Please visit the original project for more information about how to download/generate them.

    MapFile mapFile = await MapFile.from(filename, null, null);

or

    MapFile mapFile = await MapFile.using(content, null, null);

Note: Destroy the mapfile by calling ``dispose()`` if not needed anymore

Create the cache for assets

> assets are mostly small images to display in the map, for example parking signs, bus stop signs and so on

    SymbolCache symbolCache = FileSymbolCache();

Create the displayModel which defines and holds the view/display settings like maximum zoomLevel.

    DisplayModel displayModel = DisplayModel();

Note: For crisper maps consider to set the deviceScaleFactor to a higher value, e.g. 2

Create the render theme which specifies how to render the informations from the mapfile.

> You can think of it like a css-file for mapsforge

    RenderTheme renderTheme = await
    RenderThemeBuilder.create(displayModel, "assets/render_themes/defaultrender.xml");

Create the Renderer.

> The renderer is the rendering engine for the mapfiles. This code does the main work to render the contents of a mapfile together with the design guides from the rendertheme into bitmap tiles. bitmap tiles are png files with a fixed width/height. Multiple tiles together form the mapview.

    JobRenderer jobRenderer = MapDataStoreRenderer(mapFile, renderTheme, symbolCache, true);

Alternatively use the onlineRenderer instead to provide the tiles from openstreetmap &reg;

> By using the online-renderer you will not need the rendertheme nor the mapfiles.

    JobRenderer jobRenderer = MapOnlineRenderer();

Optionally you can create a cache for the bitmap tiles. The tiles will survive a restart but may
fill the disk space.

    TileBitmapCache bitmapCache = await FileTileBitmapCache.create(jobRenderer.getRenderKey());

Note: If storing tiles at the filesystem is not desired one can also use MemoryTileBitmapCache

Glue everything together into two models.

> The mapModel holds all map-relevant informations whereas the viewModel holds all informations related to how to display the map for the current widget

    MapModel mapModel = MapModel(
      displayModel: displayModel,
      renderer: jobRenderer,
      symbolCache: symbolCache,
      tileBitmapCache: bitmapCache,
    );
    
    ViewModel viewModel = ViewModel(displayModel: displayModel);

Include the mapView in the ``build()`` method of your APP:

    FlutterMapView(mapModel: mapModel, viewModel: viewModel );

Voil√† you are done. 

---

In order to change the position in the map programmatically call the viewModel with the new position

    viewModel.setMapViewPosition(48.0901926 , 16.308939);

Similar methods exists for zooming.
