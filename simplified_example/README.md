# Simplified example

A sample Flutter project using MapsForge and a local map file. 

Note:
- This example is a bare minimum to show a map. The code is largely based on the instructions from the [README.md](https://github.com/mikes222/mapsforge_flutter/tree/master/mapsforge_flutter).
- The example presumes the Windows desktop device.

## Getting started
- Download a MapsForge map from, for example, one of the servers mentioned by [mapforge.org](https://download.mapsforge.org/), to your client. The example uses a downloaded map of [Berlin](https://download.mapsforge.org/maps/v5/europe/germany/berlin.map).

- In `main.dart`, on line 42, update the path to your downloaded map.
- Using a long tap, a marker can be added to the Map.
