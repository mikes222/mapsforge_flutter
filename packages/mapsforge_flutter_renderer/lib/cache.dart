/// Caching system library for symbol and image management.
///
/// This library provides comprehensive caching solutions for map rendering,
/// including symbol caching, image loading, and cache management. The caching
/// system is designed to optimize performance by reducing redundant loading
/// and processing of graphical assets.
///
/// Key exports:
/// - **FileSymbolCache**: File-based symbol caching implementation
/// - **ImageBundleLoader**: Efficient loading of bundled image assets
/// - **SymbolCacheMgr**: Central management of symbol caching operations
