/// Dynamic builder for constructing Uint8List with automatic capacity management.
/// 
/// This class provides an efficient way to build byte arrays when the final size
/// is unknown. It automatically grows the internal buffer as needed, doubling
/// capacity when more space is required.
/// 
/// Key features:
/// - Automatic buffer growth (starts at ~100KB)
/// - Efficient memory management with buffer doubling
/// - View-based data access (no unnecessary copying)
/// - Optimized for sequential byte appending

  /// Internal growable buffer for storing bytes.
  Uint8List _buffer = Uint8List(_kInitialSize);

  /// Returns a view of the currently stored data without copying.
  /// 
  /// Creates a Uint8List view that references only the used portion
  /// of the internal buffer, avoiding unnecessary memory allocation.
