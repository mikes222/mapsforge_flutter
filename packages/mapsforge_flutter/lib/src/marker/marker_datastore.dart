/// Abstract base class for managing collections of map markers with dynamic loading capabilities.
///
/// A MarkerDatastore provides an interface for storing, retrieving, and managing markers
/// that can be dynamically loaded based on the current map view. This enables efficient
/// handling of large marker datasets by only loading markers relevant to the visible area.
///
/// ## Key Concepts
///
/// - **Dynamic Loading**: Markers are loaded based on zoom level and visible bounding box
/// - **Change Notification**: Extends [ChangeNotifier] to trigger UI updates when markers change
/// - **Zoom-Aware**: Different markers can be shown at different zoom levels
/// - **Boundary-Based**: Markers are queried based on geographic boundaries
/// - **Generic Type Support**: Supports typed markers via generic parameter `T`
///
/// ## Lifecycle Methods
///
/// The overlay system calls these methods to manage marker loading:
///
/// 1. **[askChangeZoomlevel]**: Called when zoom level changes - opportunity to load/filter markers
/// 2. **[askChangeBoundingBox]**: Called when map moves - opportunity to load markers for new area
/// 3. **[askRetrieveMarkersToPaint]**: Called during rendering - returns markers to display
///
/// ## Implementation Strategy
///
/// Implementing classes should consider:
///
/// - **Caching**: Cache markers to avoid repeated loading
/// - **Filtering**: Filter markers by zoom level and bounding box for performance
/// - **Clustering**: Group nearby markers at lower zoom levels
/// - **Lazy Loading**: Load markers on-demand from databases or network sources
/// - **Memory Management**: Remove off-screen markers to control memory usage
///
/// ## Usage Example
///
/// ```dart
/// class MyMarkerDatastore extends MarkerDatastore<String> {
///   final List<Marker<String>> _markers = [];
///   BoundingBox? _currentBounds;
///   int _currentZoom = -1;
///
///   @override
///   void askChangeZoomlevel(int zoomlevel, BoundingBox boundingBox, PixelProjection projection) {
///     _currentZoom = zoomlevel;
///     _currentBounds = boundingBox;
///     _loadMarkersForView();
///   }
///
///   @override
///   void askChangeBoundingBox(int zoomlevel, BoundingBox boundingBox) {
///     _currentBounds = boundingBox;
///     _loadMarkersForView();
///   }
///
///   @override
///   Iterable<Marker<String>> askRetrieveMarkersToPaint() {
///     return _markers.where((marker) => _isMarkerVisible(marker));
///   }
///
///   void _loadMarkersForView() {
///     // Load markers from database/API based on _currentBounds and _currentZoom
///     // Update _markers list
///     requestRepaint(); // Notify UI of changes
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Performance Tips
///
/// - Implement efficient spatial indexing for marker queries
/// - Use marker clustering for high-density areas
/// - Cache marker data to minimize database/network requests
/// - Filter markers by zoom level to reduce rendering overhead
/// - Call [requestRepaint] only when markers actually change
///
/// See also:
/// - [MarkerDatastoreOverlay] for displaying markers from a datastore
/// - [DefaultMarkerDatastore] for a ready-to-use implementation
/// - [SingleMarkerOverlay] for displaying individual markers
abstract class MarkerDatastore<T> with ChangeNotifier {
  /// Creates a new marker datastore.
  ///
  /// Subclasses should call this constructor and initialize any required
  /// internal data structures for marker storage and management.
  MarkerDatastore();

  /// Disposes of the datastore and releases any held resources.
  ///
  /// This method should clean up any resources held by the datastore,
  /// such as database connections, network subscriptions, or cached data.
  /// Some marker types (e.g., [PoiMarker]) may also require disposal.
  ///
  /// Always call `super.dispose()` when overriding this method.
  @override
  void dispose();

  /// Called when the map zoom level changes.
  ///
  /// This method provides an opportunity to:
  /// - Load markers appropriate for the new zoom level
  /// - Apply zoom-based filtering or clustering
  /// - Update marker styles or visibility
  /// - Initialize data structures for the new view
  ///
  /// The method is called before [askChangeBoundingBox] when both zoom
  /// level and position change simultaneously.
  ///
  /// [zoomlevel] The new zoom level (typically 0-20)
  /// [boundingBox] The visible geographic area at the new zoom level
  /// [projection] The pixel projection for coordinate transformations
  ///
  /// **Implementation Notes:**
  /// - This is the primary method for zoom-aware marker management
  /// - Consider marker clustering at lower zoom levels
  /// - Filter out inappropriate markers for the zoom level
  /// - Call [requestRepaint] if markers change
  void askChangeZoomlevel(int zoomlevel, BoundingBox boundingBox, PixelProjection projection);

  /// Called when the map view moves to a new area at the same zoom level.
  ///
  /// This method is invoked when the visible map area changes but the zoom
  /// level remains the same. It provides an opportunity to:
  /// - Load markers for the newly visible area
  /// - Remove markers that are no longer visible (memory optimization)
  /// - Update cached data for the new boundary
  ///
  /// **Important Notes:**
  /// - The zoom level is guaranteed to be unchanged when this method is called
  /// - The overlay extends the visible area by [MarkerDatastoreOverlay.extendMargin]
  ///   to reduce the frequency of these calls during map navigation
  /// - This method is not called if the bounding box is still contained within
  ///   the previously cached extended boundary
  ///
  /// [zoomlevel] The current zoom level (unchanged from previous call)
  /// [boundingBox] The new visible geographic area (already extended by margin)
  ///
  /// **Performance Tip:** Use spatial indexing to efficiently query markers
  /// within the bounding box rather than checking all markers.
  void askChangeBoundingBox(int zoomlevel, BoundingBox boundingBox);

  /// Returns the markers that should be rendered on the current screen.
  ///
  /// This method is called during each paint cycle to get the list of markers
  /// that should be visible. The returned markers will be rendered by
  /// [MarkerDatastorePainter] using their individual render methods.
  ///
  /// **Implementation Guidelines:**
  /// - Return only markers within the current visible area
  /// - Apply any zoom-level-based filtering
  /// - Consider marker priority or importance for overlapping markers
  /// - Return markers in rendering order (background to foreground)
  /// - Ensure good performance as this is called frequently
  ///
  /// **Performance Considerations:**
  /// - This method is called on every paint cycle
  /// - Avoid expensive operations like database queries
  /// - Use cached/pre-filtered marker lists when possible
  /// - Consider lazy evaluation for large marker sets
  ///
  /// Returns an iterable of markers to be rendered, in drawing order
  Iterable<Marker<T>> askRetrieveMarkersToPaint();

  /// Adds a single marker to the datastore.
  ///
  /// The marker will be included in future queries and rendering operations.
  /// Note that [requestRepaint] is not called automatically to allow for
  /// batch operations without triggering multiple repaints.
  ///
  /// [marker] The marker to add to the datastore
  ///
  /// **Usage Pattern:**
  /// ```dart
  /// // Single marker
  /// datastore.addMarker(myMarker);
  /// datastore.requestRepaint();
  ///
  /// // Batch operation (preferred for multiple markers)
  /// datastore.addMarker(marker1);
  /// datastore.addMarker(marker2);
  /// datastore.addMarker(marker3);
  /// datastore.requestRepaint(); // Single repaint for all
  /// ```
  ///
  /// See also: [addMarkers] for adding multiple markers efficiently
  void addMarker(Marker<T> marker);

  /// Adds multiple markers to the datastore in a batch operation.
  ///
  /// This is more efficient than calling [addMarker] multiple times
  /// as it allows for optimized batch processing and avoids multiple
  /// internal data structure updates.
  ///
  /// [markers] The collection of markers to add
  ///
  /// **Note:** [requestRepaint] is not called automatically. Call it
  /// after the batch operation to update the display.
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// datastore.addMarkers([marker1, marker2, marker3]);
  /// datastore.requestRepaint();
  /// ```
  void addMarkers(Iterable<Marker<T>> markers);

  /// Removes a specific marker from the datastore.
  ///
  /// The marker will no longer be included in queries or rendering.
  /// If the marker is not present in the datastore, this method should
  /// have no effect.
  ///
  /// [marker] The marker to remove from the datastore
  ///
  /// **Note:** [requestRepaint] is not called automatically. Call it
  /// after removal operations to update the display.
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// datastore.removeMarker(markerToRemove);
  /// datastore.requestRepaint();
  /// ```
  void removeMarker(Marker<T> marker);

  /// Removes all markers from the datastore.
  ///
  /// After calling this method, the datastore will be empty and
  /// [askRetrieveMarkersToPaint] should return an empty collection.
  /// This is useful for resetting the datastore or loading completely
  /// new marker data.
  ///
  /// **Note:** [requestRepaint] is not called automatically. Call it
  /// after clearing to update the display.
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// datastore.clearMarkers();
  /// datastore.requestRepaint();
  /// ```
  void clearMarkers();

  /// Notifies the datastore that a marker's properties have changed.
  ///
  /// This method should be called when a marker's position, appearance,
  /// or other properties are modified after it has been added to the
  /// datastore. This allows the datastore to:
  /// - Update internal indexes or caches
  /// - Re-evaluate marker visibility or filtering
  /// - Trigger any necessary reprocessing
  ///
  /// [marker] The marker that has been modified
  ///
  /// **Common Use Cases:**
  /// - Marker position changes (animation, GPS updates)
  /// - Marker style or appearance changes
  /// - Marker data or label updates
  /// - Marker visibility state changes
  ///
  /// **Note:** Consider calling [requestRepaint] if the changes affect
  /// the visual representation of the marker.
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// marker.position = newPosition;
  /// datastore.markerChanged(marker);
  /// datastore.requestRepaint();
  /// ```
  void markerChanged(Marker<T> marker);

  /// Returns markers that intersect with the given tap event area.
  ///
  /// This method is used for hit testing to determine which markers
  /// were tapped by the user. The implementation should return all
  /// markers whose visual representation intersects with the tap area.
  ///
  /// [event] The tap event containing position and area information
  /// Returns a list of markers that were hit by the tap
  ///
  /// **Implementation Guidelines:**
  /// - Check marker bounds against the tap event area
  /// - Consider marker rendering size, not just position
  /// - Return markers in priority order (most important first)
  /// - Handle overlapping markers appropriately
  /// - Return empty list if no markers are hit
  ///
  /// **Performance Note:** This method may be called frequently during
  /// user interaction, so implement efficient hit testing.
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// List<Marker<String>> tappedMarkers = datastore.getTappedMarkers(tapEvent);
  /// if (tappedMarkers.isNotEmpty) {
  ///   // Handle marker tap
  ///   showMarkerDetails(tappedMarkers.first);
  /// }
  /// ```
  List<Marker<T>> getTappedMarkers(TapEvent event);

  /// Requests a repaint of the marker overlay.
  ///
  /// This method should be called whenever the marker data changes in a way
  /// that affects the visual representation. It notifies the UI system that
  /// the markers need to be redrawn.
  ///
  /// **When to Call:**
  /// - After adding, removing, or modifying markers
  /// - When marker visibility or filtering changes
  /// - After batch operations on markers
  /// - When marker data is loaded asynchronously
  ///
  /// **Performance Considerations:**
  /// - Avoid calling this method excessively (e.g., in tight loops)
  /// - Batch multiple marker changes and call once at the end
  /// - The method is safe to call from any thread
  ///
  /// **Error Handling:**
  /// The method gracefully handles cases where no listeners are registered
  /// or when the widget tree is being disposed.
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// // Single operation
  /// datastore.addMarker(newMarker);
  /// datastore.requestRepaint();
  ///
  /// // Batch operations
  /// datastore.addMarkers(newMarkers);
  /// datastore.removeMarker(oldMarker);
  /// datastore.requestRepaint(); // Single call for all changes
  /// ```
  void requestRepaint() {
