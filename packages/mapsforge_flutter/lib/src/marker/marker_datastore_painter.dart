/// A custom painter that renders markers from a [MarkerDatastore] onto a Flutter canvas.
///
/// This painter is responsible for the actual drawing of markers on the map surface.
/// It works in conjunction with [MarkerDatastoreOverlay] to provide efficient
/// marker rendering with proper coordinate transformations and performance monitoring.
///
/// ## Key Features
///
/// - **Performance Monitoring**: Integrates with [PerformanceProfiler] to track rendering times
/// - **Coordinate Transformation**: Uses [UiRenderContext] for accurate map-to-screen coordinate conversion
/// - **Efficient Rendering**: Only renders markers returned by the datastore's query methods
/// - **Automatic Repainting**: Listens to datastore changes via [ChangeNotifier] for automatic updates
///
/// ## Rendering Process
///
/// 1. Creates a performance profiling session
/// 2. Sets up UI canvas and render context with current map position
/// 3. Queries datastore for markers to paint
/// 4. Renders each marker using its individual render method
/// 5. Completes performance profiling
///
/// ## Performance Considerations
///
/// - Rendering time is proportional to the number of visible markers
/// - Complex marker types (e.g., with custom graphics) take longer to render
/// - The painter automatically repaints when the datastore notifies of changes
/// - Use marker clustering or filtering in the datastore to optimize performance
///
/// ## Usage
///
/// This painter is typically used internally by [MarkerDatastoreOverlay] and should
/// not be instantiated directly in most cases:
///
/// ```dart
/// // Internal usage in MarkerDatastoreOverlay
/// CustomPaint(
///   foregroundPainter: MarkerDatastorePainter(mapPosition, datastore),
///   child: const SizedBox.expand(),
/// )
/// ```
///
/// See also:
/// - [MarkerDatastoreOverlay] for the complete marker overlay implementation
/// - [MarkerDatastore] for marker data management
/// - [Marker] for individual marker rendering
class MarkerDatastorePainter extends CustomPainter {
  /// The current map position providing coordinate system and transformation data.
  ///
  /// Used to create the render context that converts geographic coordinates
  /// to screen coordinates for accurate marker positioning.
  final MapPosition mapPosition;

  /// The marker datastore containing the markers to be rendered.
  ///
  /// The painter queries this datastore for markers and listens to it
  /// for change notifications that trigger repainting.
  final MarkerDatastore datastore;

  /// Creates a marker datastore painter.
  ///
  /// [mapPosition] provides the current map view and coordinate transformations
  /// [datastore] contains the markers to render and provides change notifications
  ///
  /// The painter automatically repaints when the datastore notifies of changes.
  MarkerDatastorePainter(this.mapPosition, this.datastore) : super(repaint: datastore);

  /// Renders all visible markers from the datastore onto the canvas.
  ///
  /// This method is called by Flutter's rendering system whenever the
  /// custom paint widget needs to be redrawn. The rendering process:
  ///
  /// 1. **Performance Tracking**: Starts a profiling session to monitor rendering time
  /// 2. **Context Setup**: Creates UI canvas and render context with current map transformations
  /// 3. **Marker Query**: Retrieves markers to paint from the datastore
  /// 4. **Rendering Loop**: Calls render() on each marker with the prepared context
  /// 5. **Profiling Complete**: Ends the performance session for analysis
  ///
  /// The render context provides:
  /// - Coordinate transformation from geographic to screen coordinates
  /// - Current map center as reference point
  /// - Map projection for accurate positioning
  /// - Rotation angle for proper marker orientation
  ///
  /// [canvas] The Flutter canvas to draw on
  /// [size] The size of the painting area
