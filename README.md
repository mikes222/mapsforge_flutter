# mapsforge_flutter

Pure offline maps for flutter. This is a port of mapsforge for
java/android [https://github.com/mapsforge/mapsforge]

The main feature of this library is to read *mapfiles* stored locally at the user's device and
render the mapfiles on the user's device without any internet connection.

## Credits

First and foremost to the author of mapsforge. He has done an outstanding job!

Also to the university of chemnitz which implements indoor map support

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

include the library in your ``pubspec.yaml``:

```yaml
  mapsforge_flutter: ^3.0.1
```

Note: For development purposes consider to include the github repository directly.

include a list of all used assets in your ``pubspec.yaml`` (see pubspec file from example project)

```yaml
    flutter:

      assets:
        - packages/mapsforge_flutter/assets/patterns/coniferous.svg
        - packages/mapsforge_flutter/assets/patterns/coniferous_and_deciduous.svg
        - packages/mapsforge_flutter/assets/patterns/deciduous.svg
      # and more
```

### Initializing mapsforge

Load the mapfile which holds the openstreetmap &reg; data

> Mapfiles are files specifically designed for mobile use and provide the information about an area in condensed form. Please visit the original project for more information about how to download/generate them.

    Datastore datastore = IsolateMapfile(filename);

or

    Datastore datastore = await MapFile.using(content, null, null);

The former is used to read mapfiles from the filesystem whereas the latter is used to read mapfiles from memory. 
If you do not want to use Isolates you can also use the Mapfile directly like so:

    Datastore datastore = await MapFile.from(filename, null, null);

Note: Destroy the mapfile by calling ``dispose()`` if not needed anymore

Create the cache for assets

> Assets are mostly small images to display in the map, for example parking signs, bus stop signs and so on

    SymbolCache symbolCache = FileSymbolCache();

Create the displayModel which defines and holds the view/display settings like maximum zoomLevel.

    DisplayModel displayModel = DisplayModel();

Note: For crisper maps consider to set the deviceScaleFactor to a higher value, e.g. 2

Create the render theme which specifies how to render the informations from the mapfile.

> You can think of it like a css-file for mapsforge

    RenderTheme renderTheme = await
    RenderThemeBuilder.create(displayModel, "assets/render_themes/defaultrender.xml");

Create the Renderer.

> The renderer is the rendering engine for the mapfiles. This code does the main work to render the contents 
> of a mapfile together with the design guides from the rendertheme into bitmap tiles. 
> Bitmap tiles are png files with a fixed width/height. Multiple tiles together forms the map.

    JobRenderer jobRenderer = MapDataStoreRenderer(mapFile, renderTheme, symbolCache, true);

Alternatively use the onlineRenderer instead to provide the tiles from openstreetmap &reg;

> By using the online-renderer you will not need the rendertheme nor the mapfiles.

    JobRenderer jobRenderer = MapOnlineRenderer();

Optionally you can create a cache for the bitmap tiles. The tiles will survive a restart but may
fill the disk space.

    TileBitmapCache bitmapCache = await FileTileBitmapCache.create(jobRenderer.getRenderKey());

or

    TileBitmapCache bitmapCache = await MemoryTileBitmapCache.create();

Glue everything together into two models.

> The mapModel holds all map-relevant informations whereas the viewModel holds all informations related to how to display the map for the current widget

    MapModel mapModel = MapModel(
      displayModel: displayModel,
      renderer: jobRenderer,
      symbolCache: symbolCache,
      tileBitmapCache: bitmapCache,
    );
    
    ViewModel viewModel = ViewModel(displayModel: displayModel);

Include the mapView in the ``build()`` method of your APP:

    Scaffold(
        body: 
            MapviewWidget(
                displayModel: displayModel,
                createMapModel: () async {
                    return mapModel();
                },
                createViewModel: () async {
                    return viewModel();
                },
            ),
    );

VoilÃ  you are done. 

---

In order to change the position in the map programmatically call the viewModel with the new position:

    viewModel.setMapViewPosition(48.0901926 , 16.308939);

Similar methods exists for zooming and rotation.

First take a look at the simplified example to understand how everything works together. 
Check the examples for many more features like markers, context menus and rotation.

## Recent changes

### IsolateMapfile

The system now supports mapfiles running in isolates. Instead of using ``Mapfile.from()`` just use ``IsolateMapfile()``

### Marker Context

Use ``MarkerContext`` instead of ``MarkerCallback`` for markers.

### leftUpper()

Avoid using ``mapViewPosition.getLeftUpper()``. Use ``mapViewPosition.getCenter()`` instead.

### Changes for markers

In markers use ``markerContext.mapCenter``.

This is because we do not redraw the map for every position-update but rather only if the position
gets out of the boundary of the map. 
``mapViewPosition.getCenter()`` returns the CURRENT center (=position)
whereas ``markerContext.mapCenter`` returns the center of the map which may be different if the map moved since the 
last redraw.

### Marker captions

instead of 

    xxxMarker(
        markerCaption: MarkerCaption(
            text: "abc",
        ...
        ),
    )

use

    xxxxMarker(
        ...
    )..addCaption(
        caption: "abc",
        ...
    );

> If your users are online while viewing the maps do not use that library.
> While it is possible to show online-maps there are much simpler libs available out there to perform this task.
